# CRISPRa-sgRNA-determinants

This repository is set up to track work in identifying determinants of CRISPRa activity.  

A Bayesian mixture model meta-analysis based approach is outlined in the metaAnalysis directory.  Work done by Jenny Yang during the summer of 2018 is contained in crispr-deeplearning (though no deep learning approaches was done).
